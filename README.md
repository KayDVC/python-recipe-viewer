This project was a part of a 2-version simple recipe viewer application completed as an assignment for a Python programming course I took. 

It uses Python's Pil Module and EZGraphics to create a view-only GUI that displays a recipe's basic details like name, cook & prep times, and servings created. Once the GUI is closed, it also displays the same data in a tabulated view on the command line.

To keep the app simple, the recipe data was provided by the instructor (source: unknown) via a JSON file. The data was then converted and stored as objects inline with Python's object oriented principles.

Note: As a requirement of the assignment, the program will download and store up to 64 images in GIF format. It will create a subfolder called "images" in the current directory before doing so.
